# Paymen-Processing-System
Project created for the MS in IT: Software Design and Development at the University of Denver.

The Payment Processing System allows the user to enter their credit card information, and send it as a JSON string to the processing server. The server encrypts the data and stores it into a MongoDB-based API database. The user can also view the payment history webpage, which displays the decrypted data stored in the database in chronological order The technologies used are: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and NeDB.
